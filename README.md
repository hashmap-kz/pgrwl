**pgrwl** is a PostgreSQL write-ahead log (WAL) receiver written in Go. Itâ€™s a drop-in, container-friendly alternative
to `pg_receivewal`, supporting streaming replication, encryption, compression, and remote storage (S3, SFTP).

Designed for disaster recovery and PITR (Point-in-Time Recovery), `pgrwl` ensures zero data loss (RPO=0) and seamless
integration with Kubernetes environments.

## About

- The project serves as a **research platform** to explore streaming WAL archiving with a target of **RPO=0** during
  recovery.

- _It's primarily designed for use in containerized environments._

- The utility replicates all key features of `pg_receivewal`, including automatic reconnection on connection loss,
  streaming into partial files, extensive error checking and more.

- Install as a single binary. Debug with your favorite editor and a local PostgreSQL
  container ([local-dev-infra](test/integration/environ/)).

## Usage

**[`^        back to top        ^`](#table-of-contents)**

### Receive Mode

`Receive` mode is _the main loop of the WAL receiver_.

```bash
cat <<EOF >config.yml
main:
  listen_port: 7070
  directory: wals
receiver:
  slot: pgrwl_v5
log:
  level: trace
  format: text
  add_source: true
EOF

export PGHOST=localhost
export PGPORT=5432
export PGUSER=postgres
export PGPASSWORD=postgres
export PGRWL_MODE=receive

pgrwl start -c config.yml
```

### Serve Mode

`Serve` mode is _used during restore to serve archived WAL files from storage_.

```bash
cat <<EOF >config.yml
main:
  listen_port: 7070
  directory: wals
log:
  level: trace
  format: text
  add_source: true
EOF

export PGRWL_MODE=serve

pgrwl start -c config.yml
```

### Backup Mode

`Backup` mode performs a full base backup of your PostgreSQL cluster on a configured schedule. 

```bash
cat <<EOF >config.yml
main:
  listen_port: 7070
  directory: wals
backup:
  cron: "0 0 */3 * *"
  retention:
    enable: true
    type: time
    value: "96h"
log:
  level: trace
  format: text
  add_source: true
EOF

export PGHOST=localhost
export PGPORT=5432
export PGUSER=postgres
export PGPASSWORD=postgres
export PGRWL_MODE=backup

pgrwl start -c config.yml
```


### Restore Command

`restore_command` example for postgresql.conf:

```ini
# where 'k8s-worker5:30266' represents the host and port
# of a 'pgrwl' instance running in 'serve' mode.
restore_command = 'pgrwl restore-command --serve-addr=k8s-worker5:30266 %f %p'
```

## Disaster Recovery Use Cases

**[`^        back to top        ^`](#table-of-contents)**

_The full process may look like this (a typical, rough, and simplified example):_

- A typical production setup runs **two `pgrwl` StatefulSets** in the cluster:  
  one in `receive` mode for **continuous WAL streaming**, and another in `backup` mode for scheduled **base backups**.

- In `receive` mode, `pgrwl` continuously **streams WAL files**, applies optional **compression** and **encryption**,
  uploads them to **remote storage** (such as S3 or SFTP), and enforces **retention policies** - for example, keeping
  WAL files for **four days**.

- In `backup` mode, it performs a **full base backup** of your PostgreSQL cluster on a configured schedule -  
  for instance, **once every three days** - using **streaming basebackup**, with optional **compression**
  and **encryption**. The resulting backup is also uploaded to the configured **remote storage**,
  and subject to **retention policies** for cleanup. The built-in cron scheduler enables fully automated backups without
  requiring external orchestration.

- During recovery, the same `receive` StatefulSet can be reconfigured to run in `serve` mode,  
  exposing previously archived WALs via HTTP to support **Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)** through `restore_command`.

- With this setup, you're able to restore your cluster - in the event of a crash -
  to **any second within the past three days**, using the most recent base backup and available WAL segments.

## Architecture

**[`^        back to top        ^`](#table-of-contents)**

### Design Notes

`pgrwl` is designed to **always stream WAL data to the local filesystem first**. This design ensures durability and
correctness, especially in synchronous replication setups where PostgreSQL waits for the replica to confirm the commit.

- Incoming WAL data is written directly to `*.partial` files in a local directory.
- These `*.partial` files are synced (`fsync`) after each write to ensure that WAL segments are fully durable on disk.
- Once a WAL segment is fully received, the `*.partial` suffix is removed, and the file is considered complete.

**Compression and encryption** are applied only after a WAL segment is completed:

- Completed files are passed to the uploader worker, which may compress and/or encrypt them before uploading to a remote
  backend (e.g., S3, SFTP).
- The uploader worker **ignores partial files** and operates only on finalized, closed segments.

This model avoids the complexity and risk of streaming incomplete WAL data directly to remote storage, which can lead to
inconsistencies or partial restores. By ensuring that all WAL files are locally durable and only completed files are
uploaded, `pgrwl` guarantees restore safety and clean segment handoff for disaster recovery.

In short: **PostgreSQL requires acknowledgments for commits in synchronous setups**, and relying on external systems for
critical paths (like WAL streaming) could introduce unacceptable delays or failures. This architecture mitigates that
risk.

### Durability & `fsync`

- After each WAL segment is written, an `fsync` is performed on the currently open WAL file to ensure durability.
- An `fsync` is triggered when a WAL segment is completed and the `*.partial` file is renamed to its final form.
- An `fsync` is triggered when a keepalive message is received from the server with the `reply_requested` option set.
- Additionally, `fsync` is called whenever an error occurs during the receive-copy loop.

### Why Not `archive_command`?

Thereâ€™s a significant difference between using `archive_command` and archiving WAL files via the streaming replication
protocol.

The `archive_command` is triggered only after a WAL file is fully completed-typically when it reaches 16 MiB (the
default segment size). This means that in a crash scenario, you could lose up to 16 MiB of data.

You can mitigate this by setting a lower `archive_timeout` (e.g., 1 minute), but even then, in a worst-case scenario,
you risk losing up to 1 minute of data.
Also, itâ€™s important to note that PostgreSQL preallocates WAL files to the configured `wal_segment_size`, so they are
created with full size regardless of how much data has been written. (Quote from documentation:
_It is therefore unwise to set a very short `archive_timeout` - it will bloat your archive storage._).

In contrast, streaming WAL archiving-when used with replication slots and the `synchronous_standby_names`
parameter-ensures that the system can be restored to the latest committed transaction.
This approach provides true zero data loss (**RPO=0**), making it ideal for high-durability requirements.
